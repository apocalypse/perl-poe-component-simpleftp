BEGIN {

=func DEBUG

Enable this if you want to get debugging output. Do it like this:

	sub POE::Component::Client::SimpleFTP::DEBUG () { 1 }
	use POE::Component::Client::SimpleFTP;

The default is: false

=cut

	if ( ! defined &DEBUG ) { *DEBUG = sub () { 0 } }
}

=attr alias

The alias this component will use. You can send commands to the ftpd in 2 ways:

	my $ftp = POE::Component::Client::SimpleFTP->new( alias => "ftp", ... );
	$poe_kernel->post( 'ftp', 'cd', 'foobar' );

	# Or, you can use the yield sub:
	$ftp->yield( 'cd', 'foobar' );

The default is: ftp

=cut

has alias => (
	isa => 'Str',
	is => 'ro',
	default => 'ftp',
);

=attr username

The FTP username you will be sending to the server.

required.

=cut

has username => (
	isa => 'Str',
	is => 'ro',
	required => 1,
);

=attr password

The FTP password you will be sending to the server.

required.

=cut

has password => (
	isa => 'Str',
	is => 'ro',
	required => 1,
);

=attr remote_addr

The IP address of the FTP server to connect to. Can be a DNS hostname or IPv4/6 string.

required.

=cut

has remote_addr => (
	isa => 'Str',
	is => 'ro',
	required => 1,
);

=attr remote_port

The port of the FTP server to connect to.

The default is: 21

=cut

has remote_port => (
	isa => 'Int',
	is => 'ro',
	default => 21,
);

=attr local_addr

The local IP address to bind to for all connections to the server.

The default is: INADDR_ANY ( let the OS decide )

=cut

has local_addr => (
	isa => 'Str',
	is => 'ro',
	default => INADDR_ANY,
);

=attr local_port

The local port to bind to for the control connection to the server. If you need to change the data connection's port, please
change the L</local_data_port> attribute.

The default is: 0 ( let the OS decide )

=cut

has local_port => (
	isa => 'Int',
	is => 'ro',
	default => 0,
);

=attr local_data_port

The local port to bind to for the data connection to the server. Must be a different port than the L</local_port> attribute!

The default is: 0 ( let the OS decide )

=cut

has local_data_port => (
	isa => 'Int',
	is => 'ro',
	default => 0,
);

=attr tls_cmd

A boolean value to enable/disable TLS encryption of the command connection. If you want to use this,
you must have L<POE::Component::SSLify> installed!

The default is: false

=cut

has tls_cmd => (
	isa => 'Bool',
	is => 'ro',
	writer => '_set_tls_cmd',
	default => 0,
);

=attr tls_data

A boolean value to enable/disable TLS encryption of the data connection. If you want to use this,
you must have L<POE::Component::SSLify> installed!

The default is: false

=cut

has tls_data => (
	isa => 'Bool',
	is => 'ro',
	writer => '_set_tls_data',
	default => 0,
);

=attr timeout

A value specifying the timeout in seconds for the initial connection to the FTP server.

The default is: 120

=cut

has timeout => (
	isa => 'Int',
	is => 'ro',
	default => 120,
);

=attr connection_mode

Determine what connection mode we will be using when opening the data connection to the server. In "active" mode,
the server will be connecting to us. In "passive" mode we will be connecting to the server. You usually need "passive" mode
if you are behind a firewall.

The default is: passive

=cut

	use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;

	has connection_mode => (
		isa => enum( [ qw( active passive ) ] ),
		is => 'ro',
		default => 'passive',

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# A simple FTP client logging in to a server
	use POE qw( Component::Client::SimpleFTP );

	POE::Session->create(
		inline_states => {
			_start => sub {
				POE::Component::Client::SimpleFTP->new(
					alias => "ftp",
					remote_addr => "invalid.addr",
					username => "myuser",
					password => "mypassword",
				);
				return;
			},
			authenticated => sub {
				print "LOGGED ON!\n";
				$_[KERNEL]->post( "ftp", "quit" );
				return;
			}
		},
	);
	POE::Kernel->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple FTP client to use in a POE application. It's a complete rewrite of the old L<POE::Component::Client::FTP> codebase and makes
it easier to use. Most of the API/event flow is compatible, so you should have few problems porting your code to this module.

You start by creating the ftp object and wait for it to send you events. By default the caller session will get all the events directed to it,
no need to "register" for events or anything like that. Events are sent to you in the generic form of C<$command> or C<${command}_error> events.
This module will parse the FTP reply codes and determine if it is an error or not, and dispatch it to the appropriate event.

An important thing to keep in mind is that there is no command queueing done in this module. It is up to the user to know what state they are
in and to dispatch events at the right time. If a command is sent while this module is processing one, an exception will be thrown. Fortunately,
due to the way events are named, it should be easy to keep track of the event flow.

=head2 Initial Connection

When the object is created, it attempts to make a connection to the server specified in the attributes. It will automatically login with the
provided credentials. Additionally, it will enable TLS mode if you enabled the attributes L</tls_cmd> and L</tls_data>. There is a timeout timer
on the initial connection that you can tweak via setting L</timeout>.

The following events may be sent to your session:

=head3 connected

This event is sent when the initial connection to the server is established. The connection is not yet finalized, so you aren't able to send
commands yet!

The first argument is the string banner that the server sent, if any.

=head3 authenticated

This event is sent when the entire login procedure is done. At this point you can send commands to the server.

The first argument is the string banner that the server sent, if any.

=head3 connect_error

This event is sent when there's an error connecting to the server. The component will automatically destroy itself at this point, so if you
want to retry the connection, you have to make a new object.

The first argument is the error code, and the 2nd argument is the error string.

The code "0" is used here, because we never got a reply from the server. However, it is nice to have consistency with the other
event handlers, so it is supplied.

Example code: 0

Example reply: timedout

=head3 login_error

This event is sent when there's an error trying to login to the server. The component will automatically destroy itself at this point, so if you
want to retry the connection, you have to make a new object.

The first argument is the error code, and the 2nd argument is the error string.

Example code: 530

Example reply: Login incorrect.

=head2 Simple Commands

This is a class of commands that can be sent to the server after receiving the L</authenticated> event. They perform identically, and will send
the same replies back to your session. Some commands require arguments, others don't.

Normally the events will include at least 2 arguments: the FTP return code and the actual reply line from the server. If the command included
arguments, it will be supplied in the event to make identifying actions easier.

Some commands is an alias for the actual command ( cd vs cwd ) but the event name will follow the aliased command. If a cwd event is sent, the
error event is C<cwd_error>. If a cd event is sent, the error event is C<cd_error>.

	# send the cd command in an event handler somewhere
	$ftp->yield( 'cd', '/foobar' );

	# handler for the resulting event received from this component
	sub cd {
		my( $code, $reply, $path ) = @_[ ARG0 .. ARG2 ];

		# $code probably is 250
		# $reply probably is "Directory successfully changed."
		# $path will be "/foobar"
	}

	sub cd_error {
		my( $code, $reply, $path ) = @_[ ARG0 .. ARG2 ];

		# $code probably is 550
		# $reply probably is "Failed to change directory."
		# $path will be "/foobar"
	}

=head3 cwd

Changes the working directory.

Arguments: the path to change to ( required )

Example code: 250

Example reply: Directory successfully changed.

=head3 cd

An alias for L</cwd>

=head3 dele

Deletes a file.

Arguments: the file to delete ( required )

Example code: 250

Example reply: Delete operation successful.

=head3 delete

An alias for L</dele>

=head3 mkd

Creates a directory.

Arguments: the directory path to create ( required )

You can supply an absolute path or a relative path. It is up to the server to figure out where to create the directory. It's easier to use
absolute paths so you are sure that the server is creating the directory in the right place!

Remember, the FTP protocol doesn't support recursive directory creation! If C</foo> exists but C</foo/bar> doesn't, then you cannot create
C</foo/bar/baz>!

Example code: 257

Example reply: "/foo" created

=head3 mkdir

An alias for L</mkd>

=head3 rmd

Removes a directory.

Arguments: the directory path to delete ( required )

You can supply an absolute path or a relative path. It is up to the server to figure out where to delete the directory. It's easier to use
absolute paths so you are sure that the server is deleting the right directory!

Example code: 250

Example reply: Remove directory operation successful.

=head3 rmdir

An alias for L</rmd>

=head3 cdup

Changes the working directory to the parent.

Remember, there might be symlinks or other bizarre stuff going on behind the scenes! It's best to supply full pathnames to L</cwd> to be safe.

Arguments: none

Example code: 250

Example reply: Directory successfully changed.

=head3 pwd

Prints the current working directory.

Arguments: none

Example code: 257

Example reply: "/"

=head3 rename

Renames a target file to a new name.

Arguments: the old filename and the new filename

Remember, the pathnames must exist and is a valid target. Best to send absolute paths!

Example code: 250

Example reply: Rename successful.

=head3 mv

An alias for L</rename>

=head3 quit

Disconnects from the server. Behaves differently depending on the context when this command is received. After this command is sent, this
module will destroy itself and not send any more events to your session.

If this module isn't processing anything it will send the QUIT command and gracefully shutdown when it receives the server reply.

If this module is processing a command it will disconnect immediately, killing any command processing/data transfers that is happening.

If you want to force immediate shutdown, use the L</shutdown> event.

Arguments: none

=head3 disconnect

An alias for L</quit>

=head3 shutdown

Forces a shutdown of the component and kills everything.

Arguments: none

=head3 noop

Executes a no-operation command. Useful to keep the connection open or to get the round-trip latency, or whatever :)

Arguments: none

Example code: 200

Example reply: NOOP ok.

=head3 quot

Sends a quoted command to the server. Useful for sending commands that this module doesn't support.

Arguments: the actual command + arguments to send.

	$ftp->yield( 'quot', 'CRAZYCMD', @crazy_args );

=head3 quote

An alias for L</quot>

=head3 help

Gets the server's help output for a command.

Arguments: optional command to ask for help

Example code: 214

Example reply:

	The following commands are recognized.
	ABOR ACCT ALLO APPE CDUP CWD  DELE EPRT EPSV FEAT HELP LIST MDTM MKD
	MODE NLST NOOP OPTS PASS PASV PORT PWD  QUIT REIN REST RETR RMD  RNFR
	RNTO SITE SIZE SMNT STAT STOR STOU STRU SYST TYPE USER XCUP XCWD XMKD
	XPWD XRMD
	Help OK.

=head3 site

Executes a specific command that the server supports. Consult your ftp administrator or the document for the ftpd software for more information.

Arguments: the command to execute + any optional arguments.

Example code: 500

Example reply: Unknown SITE command.

=head3 stat

Receives some informational text about the current status of the connection.

BEWARE: While the RFC says this command can be sent while a data transfer is in progress, this is unimplemented!

Arguments: none

Example code: 211

Example reply:

	FTP server status:
	Connected to 192.168.0.199
	Logged in as apoc
	TYPE: ASCII

You can use the L<POE::Component::Client::SimpleFTP::Utils/feat_parser> function to convert it into an array of features.

=head3 features

An alias for L</feat>

=head3 opts

Sets an option for the current session. Not supported by all servers! ( RFC 2389 )

Arguments: the option to set

Example code: 501

Example reply: Option not understood.

=head3 options

An alias for L</opts>

=head2 Complex Commands

This class of commands is called complex because they require opening a new data connection to the server. The requested data is transferred
over this connection, and the result is sent back to your session. All of the commands behave the same except for the "upload" types.

Please look at the C<examples> directory included in this distribution for code samples.

The typical flow of this command is as follows:

	$ftp->yield( 'get', "/myfile.txt" );

	# receive a "get_connected" event
	#	args is: "/myfile.txt"

	# at this point you prepare to process the incoming data

	# receive a "get_data" event
	#	args is: $chunk, "/myfile.txt"

	# at this point you should write out the data to the terminal, a file, or whatever!

	# ... keep receiving "get_data" until the server finish sending

	# receive a "get" event
	#	args is: $code, $reply, "/myfile.txt"

	# at this point the transfer is complete

	# if at any point there is an error, a "get_error" event is sent
	#	args is: $code, $reply, "/myfile.txt"

For the "upload" events where you are sending data to the server, the flow is:

	$ftp->yield( 'put', '/myfile.txt' );

	# receive a "put_connected" event
	#	args is: "/myfile"

	# at this point you should get the data to send to the server
	# from your local filesystem, from a database server, or whatever!

	# send a chunk of data to the server
	# the chunk size should depend on your application - a reasonable default is 10240 bytes
	$ftp->yield( 'put_data', $chunk );

	# receive a "put_flushed" event
	#	args is: "/myfile"

	# at this point, you can either send another chunk or signal EOF
	$ftp->yield( 'put_close' );

	# receive a "put" event
	#	args is: $code, $reply, "/myfile"

	# at this point the transfer is complete

	# if at any point there is an error, a "put_error" event is sent
	#	args is: $code, $reply, "/myfile"

=head3 list

Receives a directory list. The data is sent in a format similar to the UNIX "ls" command, but can be anything!

Arguments: the optional path to query ( defaults to current working directory )

Example data:

	drwxr-xr-x    4 1000     1000         4096 May 02 18:24 a
	drwxr-xr-x    4 1000     1000         4096 May 02 18:24 b
	drwxr-xr-x    4 1000     1000         4096 May 02 18:24 c
	-rw-r--r--    1 1000     1000            0 May 02 20:26 foo.txt

=head3 ls

An alias for L<list>

=head3 nlst

Receives a directory list. Differs from L<list> in that only the names are received.

Arguments: the optional path to query ( defaults to current working directory )

Example data:

	a
	b
	c
	foo.txt

=head3 dir

An alias for L</nlst>

=head3 retr

Retrieves a file from the server.

Arguments: the filename to receive

=head3 get

An alias for L</get>

=head3 stor

Transmits a file to the server. This uses the "upload" command flow explained in L</Complex Commands>!

Arguments: the filename to put

=head3 stou

Transmits a file to the server. This differs from L</stor> in that the ftp server is required to store the file in a unique way. This uses the
"upload" command flow explained in L</Complex Commands>!

Arguments: the filename to put

=head3 put

An alias for L</stor>

=head1 TLS support

TLS encryption is available if you want. You would need to enable the L</tls_cmd> and L</tls_data> attributes and have L<POE::Component::SSLify>
installed in order to use it. It should work with a lot of servers and commands. However, not the entire specification is implemented!
If you encounter problems when using TLS on a server, please let me know by filing a bug report!

=head1 Unimplemented Commands/Actions/Features

Those are the ideas that probably will be implemented in a future version. Some of them require core changes to this module, while others
can be done in user-space but should be implemented here to make it "simpler" :)

	* full TLS support - check the RFCs
	* FXP ( server<->server ) transfers
	* intelligent NAT detection
	* full ipv6 compatibility
	* restart/abort/append a transfer
	* bandwidth throttling for data connection
	* support for "mkdir -p" where this module automatically creates all directories needed
	* passing a filename/filehandle/whatever to put/get so this module automatically does the reading/writing
	* directory mirroring ( ala rsync )
	* use POE::Filter::Ls for parsing ( need to improve it first hah )
	* encoded pathnames ( translate \012 in filename to \000 as per RFC 959 )
	* security stuff - http://cr.yp.to/ftp/security.html
	* event prefix ( so you get ftp_cd events instead of cd ) for easier event management
	* strict command validation ( we don't check if the command requires 0, 1, or N args )

=head2 RFC 959 "FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL (FTP)"

	* REIN ( not allowed, as it generally screws up - just reconnect! )
	* STRU ( default file type is always a good idea )
	* MODE ( default stream type is always a good idea )
	* APPE ( should be easy to implement, but im lazy )
	* ALLO ( it is generally unused and obsolete? )
	* REST ( a bit tricky to implement, maybe later )
	* ABOR ( not allowed, as it generally screws up - just disconnect! )
	* PASV ( this module automatically does it )
	* PORT ( this module automatically does it )
	* TYPE ( this module automatically does it )
	* STAT ( implemented, but not allowed while a transfer is in progress as it generally screws things up )

=head2 RFC 2228 "FTP Security Extensions"

	* AUTH ( only AUTH TLS is supported now )
	* PROT/PBSZ is supported with the default options if you enable tls_cmd/tls_data
	* ADAT ( not needed for AUTH TLS? )
	* CCC ( not needed with TLS? )
	* MIC ( not needed with TLS? )
	* CONF ( not needed with TLS? )
	* ENC ( not needed with TLS? )

=head2 RFC 2389 "Feature negotiation mechanism for the File Transfer Protocol"

	* The entire RFC is implemented

=head2 RFC 2428 "FTP Extensions for IPv6 and NATs"

	* EPRT
	* EPSV

=head2 RFC 2577 "FTP Security Considerations"

	* unimplemented

=head2 RFC 2640 "Internationalization of the File Transfer Protocol"

	* unimplemented

=head2 RFC 3659 "Extensions to FTP"

	* REST ( same reason as the RFC 959 one )
	* MLST
	* MLSD

=head2 RFC 4217 "Securing FTP with TLS"

	* unimplemented except for what is implemented in 2228 :)

=head2 RFC 5796 "FTP Command and Extension Registry"

	* No need to implement this, it is for servers only
